Pacman 5x3 example:

   x12345
  y#######    B - beginning cell (1,1), Pacman starts here and need to reach end cell.
  1#B    #    G - side Ghost (1,3), always siting in this cell, so Pacman should just avoid to step here.
  2## ## #    G - on way Ghost (2,3), appear for some fixed amount of time and then disappear.
  3#GGE  #    E - end cell (3,3), Pacman should reach it for minimum amount of the moves (since each move cost some penalty).
   #######

Pacman will got:
 1. Small penalty for each move (exepth for pass move), so need to find shortest way.
 2. A bit bigger penalty for each hitting of walls, so need to learn to not step in to the wall.
 3. Huge penalty and reset of position to beginning (1,1) for meet the Ghost (for step in to the Ghost cell).
 4. Prize for reaching the end cell (3,3).

There is 2 ways:
  1. (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(3,3):
     This way is shorter so cost less, but Pacman can meet Goust and then game will end with huge penalty
  2. (1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(4,1)->(5,1->(5,2)->(5,3)->(4,3)->(3,3)
     This way is longer so cost more, but it is safe.

Map variables:
  Pacman observe the cell in front of him and see it number and type, also type of obje—Åt in the cell. Pacman
can move forward (step into the cell in fromt of him), rotate left and right, also do nothing.

Input hidden variables: 
  cell number: 'C', {<number in format (x,y)>}
  cell type:   'T', {'f' - free cell, 'w' - wall}
  object type: 'O', {'b' - beginning cell, 'e' - end cell, 'g' - cell ocupated by ghost}
  
Output hidden variables:
  action: 'A', {'f' - forward, 'l' - rotate left, 'r' - rotate right, 'p' - pass (do nothing)}
